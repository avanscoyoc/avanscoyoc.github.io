I am fascinated by the influence of large predators on ecosystem processes. I am broadly interested in how land use change and trophic disturbance impact wildlife movement and behavior. What are the evolutionary consequences for migratory species in human-dominated and fragmented landscapes? How do animals move between protected areas? How can we improve ecosystem health and reduce human-wildlife conflict within altered landscapes? These are the types of questions that drive my work at the nexus of development and conservation.

I am currently a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley in the interdisciplinary Environmental Science, Policy, and Management program. Before joining the [Brashares Lab at Berkeley](https://nature.berkeley.edu/BrasharesGroup/), I managed the Data Analytics & IT Department at [Earthwatch Institute](http://earthwatch.org/), where I led initiatives to engage corporate stakeholders and volunteers in ecology field research.
